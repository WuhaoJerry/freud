00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.149
认知行为疗法——恶性循环

2
00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.790

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:16.970
认知行为疗法（CBT）关注思想、情感和行为之间的联系。

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:26.660
你对自己、世界和他人的看法通常是早期生活经历的结果。

9
00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.550CBT
主要关注当下，虽然疗法有助于理解过去以及它如何塑造你的生活

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.920


12
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.969
但更重要的是改善你的当前和未来的情况


15
00:00:41.969 --> 00:01:00.420
CBT认为有一个触发点或情境，我们会对其产生反应

19
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:25.470
从而产生情感和生理感受，最终影响我们的行为

25
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:41.579
希腊奴隶皮克图斯曾说过：“人们受到困扰的不是事物本身，而是他们对事物的看法。”

29
00:01:41.579 --> 00:02:05.930
这意味着并不是事件本身导致我们的情感和行为反应，而是我们对事件的理解和思考。

35
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:17.970
例如，深夜听到巨响时

37
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.960如
果你想到“哎呀，可能有入侵者”，你会感到害怕

39
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:35.790
如果你想到“我儿子又喝醉了”，你可能会感到愤怒


41
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:47.459
如果你认为“猫又把饼干罐打翻了”，你可能会觉得无所谓，甚至稍微恼火annoyed or if you think the cat's

44
00:02:47.459 --> 00:03:01.670
而如果你想到“我笨手笨脚的女儿安全回来了”，你会感到松了一口气

47
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:13.580
相同的事件、相同的情境，但不同的意义会导致不同的情感。


50
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:28.170
我们可以使用恶性循环图表来理解我们的情感，分析思想、情感和行为，尝试进行改变

54
00:03:28,170 -->  00:03:47,040
焦虑的恶性循环中，有一个触发点，可能是一个想法、一个情感或一个外部事件。

58
00:03:47.040 --> 00:04:02.160
焦虑时，通常会想“坏事要发生了，我无法应对”，这是一种灾难性的、对未来的极度关注

64
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:15.330
如果有人抱有这些想法并相信它们，他们就会感到焦虑、恐慌

67
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:34.050
身体的警报系统被激活，出现肾上腺素反应，导致心跳加速、呼吸急促、出汗等不适感

74
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:57.030
为了摆脱这些感受，我们往往会避免或逃避，可能会避开让我们感到焦虑的情境，或者在感到焦虑时想要逃避。

82
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:19.740
我们可能不出门，避免周末的聚会，找借口早退，或者采用“安全行为”，如在聚会上躲在角落里喝酒。


91
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:45.040
如果我们持续这样做，就会强化负面的想法，陷入焦虑的循环，感觉无法逃脱。

99
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.950
但在CBT中，我们可以学会打破这个循环

100
00:05:51.780 --> 00:06:00.900
抑郁的恶性循环同样明显

103
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:14.670
抑郁往往伴随消极的自我评价，缺乏能量，失去做事的兴趣，情绪消沉

106
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:24.700
抑郁可能逐渐加重，也可能由于某个触发事件或想法导致心情低落

109
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:48.970
我们倾向于进行消极、自我批评的思考，感到无望，对未来感到绝望，认为“没有人喜欢我”。

116
00:06:48.970 --> 00:07:10.780
这些想法会导致悲伤和抑郁，能量下降、疲惫不堪，失去动力

122
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:40.600
若我们在这种情况下退缩，孤立自己，就会陷入无法逃脱的下行螺旋

133
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.590
愤怒的恶性循环同样存在，我们对触发的想法产生愤怒

134
00:07:44.590 -->00:08:22.930
认为“这不公平”，或“这是不对的”，有一种必须纠正错误的冲动


141
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:34.120
愤怒也会激活肾上腺素反应，但这次是为了攻击，而不是逃避

145
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.909that we need to right this wrong we get

146
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.549this urge to hit out to make a noise to

147
00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:42.729shout we make ourselves look bigger or

148
00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:44.560it might be quite low key and just

149
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.340sarcastic and that sort of thing and if

150
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.350we keep responding in that same way then

151
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:57.700nothing is going to change the vicious

152
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.290cycle of stress all these emotions are

153
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:07.270normal they are normal responses to

154
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.720thoughts everybody feels anxious and

155
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.630they have a purpose you know it's good

156
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.640to feel anxious sometimes it gets us

157
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.700away from danger the trouble is

158
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.560sometimes our mind tricks us into

159
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.230thinking there is danger when there

160
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:28.630really is none this is cycle of stress

161
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.740everybody gets stressed at times

162
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.890stress is about too many demands being

163
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.589made on us and we don't have the

164
00:09:38.589 --> 00:09:43.269resources to cope so in response to a

165
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:47.890trigger we tend to think there's too

166
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.769much to do there's not enough time it's

167
00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:54.850out of control I can't cope so we feel

168
00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.730very stressed we get that drip-feed of

169
00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.980adrenaline and cortisol the stress

170
00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.220hormone which results in these horrible

171
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.140physical feelings all the time

172
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.470tense headaches forgetful and all that

173
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.600sort of thing so what do we do well if

174
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.149we haven't got enough time that we might

175
00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:18.850try and make more time at work in order

176
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.500to try and fit in everything we've got

177
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.959to do or we might think I can't cope was

178
00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:24.959going to work at all and just stay home

179
00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:28.540you might avoid and put things off lots

180
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.550of different things you might sleep more

181
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:34.420three less drink more smoke more shout

182
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.470argue less family or fun time it affects

183
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.740us in all different ways and if we don't

184
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.339make any changes in the way we sink and

185
00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:48.370in the way we behave then nothing is

186
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.850going to change

187
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.080so we need to understand our vicious

188
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.140cycle to help us to make positive

189
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:04.650changes we need to break the cycle and

190
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.980we can break the cycle by thinking

191
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.650differently by changing the way we think

192
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.520and doing differently changing the way

193
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.320we behave so if we go back to the

194
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.100vicious cycle of anxiety we can break

195
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.710this cycle by thinking differently and

196
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.510that will include learning to challenge

197
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.980our thoughts not believing our thoughts

198
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.510learning not to pay attention to our

199
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.580thoughts and learning skills that will

200
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.150help us do those things that is going to

201
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.410have an impact on the way you feel and

202
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.650if we also change our behaviors so

203
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.760instead of avoiding or escaping we make

204
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.470a plan to gradually do those things and

205
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:02.400to stick with them rather than escape we

206
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.670need to start small and build up so

207
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.510start with little things make a plan and

208
00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:12.390learn and use coping skills to help you

209
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.000cope with those situations and every

210
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.750time you go into that anxiety provoking

211
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.520situation the first time you're gonna be

212
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.550very anxious the second time you're not

213
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.920going to be quite so anxious because

214
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.650you're starting to learn that actually

215
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.870it wasn't so bad as when I thought it

216
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.560would be and the next time you go again

217
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.290you won't be quite so anxious and each

218
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.830time the anxiety will reduce and it will

219
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.000go away quicker too

220
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.430so if we think differently and do

221
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.820differently then you're gonna feel very

222
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.610differently you're going to be feeling

223
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.430much less anxious and more confident in

224
00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:02.160yourself and for depression with

225
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.130depression we start to make those

226
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.710changes in the behaviors because that's

227
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.050where the evidence says works most

228
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.440quickly most effectively we change what

229
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.010we do

230
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.440so rather than withdraw and isolate

231
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.070ourselves the need to start to go out

232
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.640more do more of the activities I enjoy

233
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.550or used to enjoy connect with other

234
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.130people so rather than cutting ourselves

235
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.300off start to make those connections

236
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.020again spending time with other people

237
00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.170gentle exercise exercise is an amazing

238
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:43.050mood enhancer now it all feels like a

239
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.100big ask at the at the beginning but

240
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.250start with the five-minute rule go for a

241
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:50.790walk

242
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.120five minutes commit to that after five

243
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.670minutes you can ask yourself is this

244
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.250helping you know how am I feeling don't

245
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.930want to carry on or actually is that

246
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.140enough for today and you can learn

247
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.210coping skills that will help you do

248
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.260those things and then you can also learn

249
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.170to challenge your thoughts change the

250
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.990way you think not just challenge but

251
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.540learn not to believe everything you

252
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.570thought say learn to not pay attention

253
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.170to your thoughts all the time start to

254
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.540notice the positives is when we're

255
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.850depressed we tend to focus on all the

256
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.610negatives on the past we ruminate and

257
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.490ruminate and get caught up in horrible

258
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.980things but we can start to notice the

259
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.150okay stuff and the good stuff

260
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.940and you can learn skills again that will

261
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.100help you do this so if you're thinking

262
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.470differently and acting differently

263
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.020that's going to have an enormous impact

264
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.790on the way you feel your mood will lift

265
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.240your energy will increase and the more

270
00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:11.650develop even more
