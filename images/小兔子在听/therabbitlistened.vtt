out of nowhere

15
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.840
things came crashing down

16
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.879

21
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.280
but taylor didn't feel like talking

22
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.180

but taylor didn't feel like remembering

34
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.360

47
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.480

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.480
anything with anybody

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.420

[Music]

51
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.720
until taylor was alone

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.599
in the quiet taylor didn't even notice

53
00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.959
the rabbit

54
00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.280
but it moved closer and closer

55
00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.800
until taylor could feel its warm body

56
00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.640
together they sat in silence until

57
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.000
taylor said
