00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:21.365
So I want to start by offering you
a free no-tech life hack,
所以我想首先为您提供
一个免费的无技术生活窍门，

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:23.986
and all it requires of you is this:
它所要求的就是：

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.173
that you change your posture
for two minutes.
您改变姿势
两分钟。

00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:31.597
But before I give it away,
I want to ask you to right now
但在我透露之前，
我想请您现在对

00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:35.190
do a little audit of your body
and what you're doing with your body.
您的身体
以及您对身体所做的事情进行一些检查。

00:00:35.214 --> 00:00:37.905
So how many of you are
sort of making yourselves smaller?
那么，你们中有多少人在
某种程度上让自己变得更小呢？

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.250
Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs,
maybe wrapping your ankles.
也许你弯腰驼背，交叉双腿，
也许包裹着脚踝。

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:44.989
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.
有时我们会像这样握住手臂。

00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:48.660
Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter)
有时我们分散开来。  （笑声）

00:00:48.684 --> 00:00:50.932
I see you.
我看到你了。

00:00:50.956 --> 00:00:53.947
So I want you to pay attention
to what you're doing right now.
所以我希望你注意
你现在正在做的事情。

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.305
We're going to come back
to that in a few minutes,
我们将
在几分钟后回到这个问题，

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.253
and I'm hoping that if you learn
to tweak this a little bit,
我希望如果你学会
稍微调整一下，

00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:02.689
it could significantly change
the way your life unfolds.
它可以显着改变
你的生活展开方式。

00:01:02.713 --> 00:01:07.213
So, we're really fascinated
with body language,
所以，我们真的
对肢体语言着迷，

00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:11.136
and we're particularly interested
in other people's body language.
而且
对其他人的肢体语言特别感兴趣。

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.357
You know, we're interested in,
like, you know — (Laughter) —
你知道，我们感兴趣的是，
比如，你知道——（笑声）——

00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:19.755
an awkward interaction, or a smile,
尴尬的互动，或者一个微笑，

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:23.987
or a contemptuous glance,
or maybe a very awkward wink,
或者一个轻蔑的眼神，
或者一个非常尴尬的眨眼，

00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:27.225
or maybe even something like a handshake.
或者甚至是握手之类的东西。

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:30.574
Narrator: Here they are
arriving at Number 10.
旁白：他们
到达了 10 号。

00:01:30.598 --> 00:01:35.067
This lucky policeman gets to shake hands
with the President of the United States.
这位幸运的警察可以
与美国总统握手。

00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:39.994
Here comes the Prime Minister --
No. (Laughter) (Applause)
总理来了 -
不。（笑声）（掌声）

00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:42.669
(Laughter) (Applause)
（笑声）（掌声）

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:46.376
Amy Cuddy: So a handshake,
or the lack of a handshake,
Amy Cuddy：所以一次握手，
或者不握手，

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.900
can have us talking for weeks
and weeks and weeks.
可以让我们谈论数周
、数周、数周。

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:51.040
Even the BBC and The New York Times.
甚至 BBC 和纽约时报。

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:54.991
So obviously when we think
about nonverbal behavior,
显然，当我们
考虑非语言行为

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:58.379
or body language -- but we call it
nonverbals as social scientists --
或肢体语言时——但我们
作为社会科学家称之为非语言——

00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:01.259
it's language, so we think
about communication.
它是语言，所以我们考虑
的是沟通。

00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:04.286
When we think about communication,
we think about interactions.
当我们考虑沟通时，
我们会考虑互动。

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.725
So what is your body language
communicating to me?
那么你的肢体语言在
向我传达什么信息呢？

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:08.791
What's mine communicating to you?
我在跟你传达什么信息？

00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:14.763
And there's a lot of reason to believe
that this is a valid way to look at this.
有很多理由相信
这是看待这个问题的有效方法。

00:02:14.787 --> 00:02:17.031
So social scientists
have spent a lot of time
因此，社会科学家
花了很多时间

00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:19.136
looking at the effects
of our body language,
研究
我们的肢体语言

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.445
or other people's body language,
on judgments.
或其他人的肢体语言
对判断的影响。

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.884
And we make sweeping judgments
and inferences from body language.
我们根据肢体语言做出全面的判断
和推论。

00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:28.874
And those judgments can predict
really meaningful life outcomes
这些判断可以预测
真正有意义的生活结果，

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:32.667
like who we hire or promote,
who we ask out on a date.
例如我们雇用或晋升谁，
我们约谁出去约会。

00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:37.352
For example, Nalini Ambady,
a researcher at Tufts University,
例如，塔夫茨大学的研究员纳里尼·安巴迪（Nalini Ambady）

00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:41.824
shows that when people watch
30-second soundless clips
表明，当人们观看
30 秒

00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:44.848
of real physician-patient interactions,
真实医患互动的无声片段时，

00:02:44.872 --> 00:02:47.681
their judgments
of the physician's niceness
他们对
医生友善的判断

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:50.318
predict whether or not
that physician will be sued.
可以预测
该医生是否会被起诉。

00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:52.000
So it doesn't have to do so much
因此，这

00:02:52.024 --> 00:02:54.523
with whether or not that physician
was incompetent,
与该医生是否无能没有太大关系
，

00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:57.353
but do we like that person
and how they interacted?
但我们是否喜欢那个人
以及他们如何互动？

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.288
Even more dramatic,
Alex Todorov at Princeton
更戏剧性的是，
普林斯顿大学的亚历克斯·托多罗夫（Alex Todorov）

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:03.965
has shown us that judgments
of political candidates' faces
向我们展示了，只需一秒钟
对政治候选人面孔的判断就可以

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.933
in just one second predict 70 percent
预测

00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:11.783
of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial
race outcomes,
美国参议院和州长
竞选结果的 70%，

00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:14.005
and even, let's go digital,
甚至，让我们走向数字化，

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:18.150
emoticons used well in online negotiations
在线谈判中使用得当的表情符号

00:03:18.174 --> 00:03:20.982
can lead you to claim more value
from that negotiation.
可以让你 从谈判中获得更多价值
。

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:24.205
If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?
如果你使用不当，那是个坏主意。 正确的？

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:27.302
So when we think of nonverbals,
we think of how we judge others,
因此，当我们想到非语言时，
我们会想到我们如何评价他人，

00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:30.204
how they judge us
and what the outcomes are.
他们如何评价我们
以及结果是什么。

00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:32.324
We tend to forget, though,
the other audience
然而，我们往往会忘记受

00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:35.759
that's influenced by our nonverbals,
and that's ourselves.
我们的非语言影响的其他观众，
那就是我们自己。

00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:38.972
We are also influenced by our nonverbals,
我们还受到我们的非语言、

00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:41.335
our thoughts and our feelings
and our physiology.
我们的思想、我们的感受
和我们的生理的影响。

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.398
So what nonverbals am I talking about?
那么我在谈论什么非语言呢？

00:03:44.422 --> 00:03:47.341
I'm a social psychologist.
I study prejudice,
我是一名社会心理学家。
我研究偏见，

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:50.068
and I teach at a competitive
business school,
在一所竞争激烈的
商学院任教，

00:03:50.092 --> 00:03:54.552
so it was inevitable that I would become
interested in power dynamics.
所以我不可避免地会对
权力动态产生兴趣。

00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:58.364
I became especially interested
in nonverbal expressions
我
对

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:00.367
of power and dominance.
权力和统治力的非语言表达特别感兴趣。

00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:03.106
And what are nonverbal expressions
of power and dominance?
什么是
权力和统治力的非语言表达？

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.189
Well, this is what they are.
嗯，这就是他们的本质。

00:04:05.213 --> 00:04:08.067
So in the animal kingdom,
they are about expanding.
所以在动物王国里，
它们是在扩张。

00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:11.077
So you make yourself big, you stretch out,
所以你让自己变得更大，你伸展，

00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:14.018
you take up space,
you're basically opening up.
你占据空间，
你基本上是在开放。

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:15.964
It's about opening up.
这是关于开放。

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:18.719
And this is true
across the animal kingdom.
在整个动物王国都是如此。

00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:20.768
It's not just limited to primates.
它不仅限于灵长类动物。

00:04:21.504 --> 00:04:24.188
And humans do the same thing. (Laughter)
人类也做同样的事情。  （笑声）

00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:27.899
So they do this both when they have
power sort of chronically,
所以，当他们
长期拥有权力时，

00:04:27.923 --> 00:04:30.900
and also when they're feeling
powerful in the moment.
以及当他们
当下感觉强大时，他们都会这样做。

00:04:30.924 --> 00:04:33.972
And this one is especially interesting
because it really shows us
这一点特别有趣，
因为它确实向我们展示了

00:04:33.996 --> 00:04:37.994
how universal and old these
expressions of power are.
这些
权力表达方式是多么普遍和古老。 杰西卡·特蕾西研究过

00:04:38.018 --> 00:04:40.593
This expression, which is known as pride,
这种被称为骄傲的表达方式

00:04:40.617 --> 00:04:42.846
Jessica Tracy has studied.
。

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.753
She shows that people
who are born with sight
她表明，
天生有视力的人和

00:04:45.777 --> 00:04:48.694
and people who are congenitally
blind do this
先天失明的人

00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:51.008
when they win at a physical competition.
在体育比赛中获胜时都会这样做。

00:04:51.032 --> 00:04:53.486
So when they cross
the finish line and they've won,
因此，当他们冲过
终点线并获胜时，

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.987
it doesn't matter if they've never
seen anyone do it.
即使他们从未
见过有人这样做也没关系。

00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:57.304
They do this.
他们这样做。

00:04:57.328 --> 00:04:59.826
So the arms up in the V,
the chin is slightly lifted.
所以双臂向上呈V字形，
下巴微微抬起。

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.913
What do we do when we feel powerless?
当我们感到无能为力时，我们该怎么办？

00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:03.692
We do exactly the opposite.
我们的做法恰恰相反。

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:06.220
We close up.
We wrap ourselves up.
我们关闭。
我们把自己包裹起来。

00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:07.588
We make ourselves small.
我们让自己变得渺小。

00:05:07.612 --> 00:05:09.968
We don't want to bump
into the person next to us.
我们不想
撞到旁边的人。

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:12.725
So again, both animals and humans
do the same thing.
同样，动物和人类都
做同样的事情。

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.705
And this is what happens
when you put together high and low power.
这就是
当你将高功率和低功率放在一起时会发生的情况。

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.831
So what we tend to
do when it comes to power
因此，
当涉及到权力时，我们倾向于做的

00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:22.484
is that we complement
the other's nonverbals.
就是补充
对方的非语言能力。

00:05:22.508 --> 00:05:24.915
So if someone is being
really powerful with us,
因此，如果有人
对我们非常强大，

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.559
we tend to make ourselves smaller.
We don't mirror them.
我们就会倾向于让自己变得更渺小。
我们不镜像他们。

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:29.173
We do the opposite of them.
我们做的与他们相反。

00:05:29.197 --> 00:05:32.372
So I'm watching this behavior
in the classroom,
那么我
在教室里观察这种行为，

00:05:32.396 --> 00:05:34.909
and what do I notice?
我注意到了什么？

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:42.162
I notice that MBA students really exhibit
the full range of power nonverbals.
我注意到 MBA 学生确实展现出了
全方位的非语言能力。

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:44.710
So you have people
who are like caricatures of alphas,
因此，有些人
就像漫画中的阿尔法，

00:05:44.734 --> 00:05:48.115
really coming into the room, they get
right into the middle of the room
真正进入房间，他们甚至在上课之前就
进入房间的中间

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.552
before class even starts,
like they really want to occupy space.
，
就像他们真的想占据空间一样。

00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:53.815
When they sit down,
they're sort of spread out.
当他们坐下时，
他们会分散开来。

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.573
They raise their hands like this.
他们像这样举起手来。 还有

00:05:55.597 --> 00:05:58.208
You have other people
who are virtually collapsing
一些人进来时
几乎崩溃了

00:05:58.232 --> 00:06:00.732
when they come in.
As soon they come in, you see it.
。
他们一进来，你就看到了。

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:03.025
You see it on their faces
and their bodies,
你可以在他们的脸上和身体上看到这一点
，

00:06:03.049 --> 00:06:05.843
and they sit in their chair
and they make themselves tiny,
他们坐在椅子上，
把自己变得很小，

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:08.205
and they go like this
when they raise their hand.
当他们举起手时，他们就是这样。

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.087
I notice a couple of things about this.
我注意到有关于此的一些事情。

00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:11.921
One, you're not going to be surprised.
第一，你不会感到惊讶。

00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:13.963
It seems to be related to gender.
好像和性别有关。

00:06:13.987 --> 00:06:19.428
So women are much more likely
to do this kind of thing than men.
所以女性
比男性更容易做这种事情。

00:06:19.452 --> 00:06:22.014
Women feel chronically
less powerful than men,
女性长期感觉自己
不如男性强大，

00:06:22.038 --> 00:06:23.896
so this is not surprising.
所以这并不奇怪。

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.969
But the other thing I noticed
但我注意到的另一件事

00:06:25.993 --> 00:06:28.635
is that it also seemed
to be related to the extent
是，这似乎也
与

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:32.495
to which the students were participating,
and how well they were participating.
学生参与的程度
以及参与的程度有关。

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:35.077
And this is really important
in the MBA classroom,
这
在 MBA 课堂上非常重要，

00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:37.758
because participation
counts for half the grade.
因为参与
度占成绩的一半。

00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:42.231
So business schools have been struggling
with this gender grade gap.
因此，商学院一直在努力解决
这种性别成绩差距。

00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:45.503
You get these equally qualified
women and men coming in
你让这些同等资格的
女性和男性进来，

00:06:45.527 --> 00:06:47.670
and then you get
these differences in grades,
然后你就会发现
成绩上的差异，

00:06:47.694 --> 00:06:50.759
and it seems to be partly
attributable to participation.
这似乎部分
归因于参与。

00:06:50.783 --> 00:06:53.782
So I started to wonder, you know, okay,
所以我开始想，你知道，好吧，

00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:57.424
so you have these people coming in
like this, and they're participating.
所以你让这些人像
这样进来，他们正在参与。

00:06:57.448 --> 00:06:59.977
Is it possible that we could
get people to fake it
我们是否有可能
让人们伪造它

00:07:00.001 --> 00:07:02.001
and would it lead them
to participate more?
并会导致他们
更多地参与？

00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:06.614
So my main collaborator
Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,
所以我的主要合作者
达纳·卡尼（Dana Carney）在伯克利大学，

00:07:06.638 --> 00:07:10.169
and I really wanted to know,
can you fake it till you make it?
我真的很想知道，
你能假装它直到你成功吗？

00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:12.720
Like, can you do this
just for a little while
比如，你能这样做
一段时间，

00:07:12.744 --> 00:07:15.396
and actually experience
a behavioral outcome
并真正体验到

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.122
that makes you seem more powerful?
让你看起来更强大的行为结果吗？

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:20.574
So we know that our nonverbals
govern how other people
所以我们知道，我们的非语言行为
决定着其他人

00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:22.979
think and feel about us.
There's a lot of evidence.
对我们的看法和感受。
有很多证据。

00:07:23.003 --> 00:07:24.425
But our question really was,
但我们真正的问题是，

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.489
do our nonverbals govern
how we think and feel about ourselves?
我们的非语言行为是否决定了
我们对自己的思考和感受？

00:07:28.513 --> 00:07:31.179
There's some evidence that they do.
有一些证据表明他们确实这样做。

00:07:31.203 --> 00:07:35.815
So, for example, we smile
when we feel happy,
所以，举例来说，
当我们感到快乐时，我们会微笑，

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.993
but also, when we're forced to smile
而且，当我们像这样用牙齿叼着笔被迫微笑时

00:07:38.017 --> 00:07:42.408
by holding a pen in our teeth
like this, it makes us feel happy.
，也会让我们感到快乐。

00:07:42.432 --> 00:07:44.350
So it goes both ways.
所以这是双向的。

00:07:44.374 --> 00:07:48.156
When it comes to power,
it also goes both ways.
当谈到权力时，
它也是双向的。

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.704
So when you feel powerful,
因此，当你感觉自己很强大时，

00:07:50.728 --> 00:07:52.499
you're more likely to do this,
你就更有可能这样做，

00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:58.701
but it's also possible
that when you pretend to be powerful,
但也有可能
当你假装很强大时，

00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:02.124
you are more likely
to actually feel powerful.
你更有可能
真正感到自己很强大。

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:05.184
So the second question
really was, you know,
所以第二个问题
确实是，你知道，

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:07.767
so we know that our minds
change our bodies,
所以我们知道我们的思想会
改变我们的身体，

00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:12.184
but is it also true
that our bodies change our minds?
但是
我们的身体也会改变我们的思想吗？

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:14.911
And when I say minds,
in the case of the powerful,
当我说思想时，
就强者而言，

00:08:14.935 --> 00:08:16.283
what am I talking about?
我在说什么？

00:08:16.307 --> 00:08:18.449
So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings
所以我谈论的是思想和感受，

00:08:18.473 --> 00:08:22.045
and the sort of physiological things
that make up our thoughts and feelings,
以及
构成我们的思想和感受的生理因素，就

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:25.112
and in my case, that's hormones.
I look at hormones.
我而言，这就是荷尔蒙。
我看荷尔蒙。

00:08:25.136 --> 00:08:29.446
So what do the minds of the powerful
versus the powerless look like?
那么，强者与弱者的思想是什么
样的呢？ 毫不奇怪，

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.742
So powerful people tend to be,
not surprisingly,
如此强大的人往往会更加自信、

00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:37.966
more assertive and more confident,
more optimistic.
更加自信、
更加乐观。

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.276
They actually feel they're going to win
even at games of chance.
他们实际上觉得
即使在机会游戏中他们也会获胜。

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.144
They also tend to be able
to think more abstractly.
他们也往往能够进行
更抽象的思考。

00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:47.788
So there are a lot of differences.
They take more risks.
所以有很多差异。
他们承担更多的风险。

00:08:47.812 --> 00:08:51.051
There are a lot of differences
between powerful and powerless people.
有权力的人和无权力的人之间有很多区别。 从

00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:53.895
Physiologically,
there also are differences
生理学角度来看，

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:57.960
on two key hormones: testosterone,
which is the dominance hormone,
两种关键激素也存在差异：睾酮（
主导激素）

00:08:57.984 --> 00:09:01.654
and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.
和皮质醇（应激激素）。

00:09:01.678 --> 00:09:08.799
So what we find is that high-power
alpha males in primate hierarchies
所以我们发现，
灵长类动物等级中的高权力雄性领袖

00:09:08.823 --> 00:09:11.997
have high testosterone and low cortisol,
具有高睾酮和低皮质醇，

00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:14.929
and powerful and effective leaders
而强大而有效的领导者

00:09:15.547 --> 00:09:17.778
also have high testosterone
and low cortisol.
也具有高睾酮
和低皮质醇。

00:09:17.802 --> 00:09:20.183
So what does that mean?
When you think about power,
那么这是什么意思呢？
当你想到权力时，

00:09:20.207 --> 00:09:22.506
people tended to think
only about testosterone,
人们往往
只想到睾丸激素，

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.294
because that was about dominance.
因为那意味着统治地位。

00:09:24.318 --> 00:09:27.764
But really, power is also about
how you react to stress.
但实际上，力量还在于
你如何应对压力。

00:09:27.788 --> 00:09:30.893
So do you want the high-power
leader that's dominant,
那么，你想要一个高权力的
领导者吗？他具有主导地位，

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:33.635
high on testosterone,
but really stress reactive?
睾丸激素水平高，
但对压力非常敏感？

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:35.200
Probably not, right?
可能不会，对吧？

00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:38.254
You want the person who's powerful
and assertive and dominant,
你想要的是一个有力量
、自信、有统治力的人，

00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:41.942
but not very stress reactive,
the person who's laid back.
但又不太容易受到压力影响，是一个
悠闲的人。

00:09:41.966 --> 00:09:47.092
So we know that in primate hierarchies,
所以我们知道，在灵长类等级制度中，

00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:50.184
if an alpha needs to take over,
如果一个阿尔法需要接管，

00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:54.422
if an individual needs to take over
an alpha role sort of suddenly,
如果一个个体需要
突然接管阿尔法角色，

00:09:54.446 --> 00:09:57.533
within a few days,
that individual's testosterone has gone up
在几天之内，
该个体的睾丸激素会

00:09:57.557 --> 00:10:01.038
significantly and his cortisol
has dropped significantly.
显着上升，而他的皮质醇
会显着下降。

00:10:01.062 --> 00:10:04.079
So we have this evidence,
both that the body can shape
所以我们有证据表明，
身体可以塑造

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:06.445
the mind, at least at the facial level,
心灵，至少在面部层面，

00:10:06.469 --> 00:10:10.574
and also that role changes
can shape the mind.
而且角色的变化也
可以塑造心灵。

00:10:10.598 --> 00:10:13.356
So what happens, okay,
you take a role change,
那么会发生什么，好吧，
你进行角色改变，

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.940
what happens if you do that
at a really minimal level,
如果你
在一个非常小的水平上这样做，

00:10:15.964 --> 00:10:18.393
like this tiny manipulation,
this tiny intervention?
比如这种微小的操纵，
这种微小的干预，会发生什么？

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:21.227
"For two minutes," you say,
"I want you to stand like this,
“两分钟，”你说，
“我希望你像这样站着，

00:10:21.251 --> 00:10:23.787
and it's going to make you feel
more powerful."
这会让你感觉
更有力量。”

00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:26.741
So this is what we did.
这就是我们所做的。

00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:31.356
We decided to bring people into the lab
and run a little experiment,
我们决定带人们进入实验室
并进行一个小实验，

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.905
and these people adopted, for two minutes,
这些人在两分钟内采用了

00:10:34.929 --> 00:10:38.389
either high-power poses
or low-power poses,
高功率姿势
或低功率姿势，

00:10:38.413 --> 00:10:40.730
and I'm just going to show
you five of the poses,
我将向
您展示其中五个姿势，

00:10:40.754 --> 00:10:42.315
although they took on only two.
尽管它们 只承担了两个。

00:10:42.339 --> 00:10:43.819
So here's one.
所以这是一个。 还有

00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:46.358
A couple more.
几个。

00:10:47.052 --> 00:10:51.805
This one has been dubbed
the "Wonder Woman" by the media.
这位被
媒体称为“神奇女侠”的人。

00:10:51.906 --> 00:10:53.204
Here are a couple more.
这里还有一些。

00:10:53.228 --> 00:10:55.558
So you can be standing
or you can be sitting.
所以你可以站着，
也可以坐着。

00:10:55.582 --> 00:10:57.543
And here are the low-power poses.
这是低功率姿势。

00:10:57.567 --> 00:11:00.297
So you're folding up,
you're making yourself small.
所以你折叠起来，
你让自己变小。

00:11:01.904 --> 00:11:03.345
This one is very low-power.
这个功率非常低。

00:11:03.369 --> 00:11:07.328
When you're touching your neck,
you're really protecting yourself.
当你触摸自己的脖子时，
你实际上是在保护自己。

00:11:07.352 --> 00:11:09.349
So this is what happens.
所以这就是发生的事情。

00:11:09.467 --> 00:11:11.673
They come in, they spit into a vial,
他们进来，向小瓶吐口水，

00:11:11.697 --> 00:11:14.846
for two minutes, we say,
"You need to do this or this."
持续两分钟，我们说，
“你需要这样做或这样做。”

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.911
They don't look at pictures of the poses.
他们不看姿势照片。

00:11:16.935 --> 00:11:19.462
We don't want to prime them
with a concept of power.
我们不想让他们灌输
权力概念。

00:11:19.486 --> 00:11:21.119
We want them to be feeling power.
我们希望他们感受到力量。

00:11:21.143 --> 00:11:22.478
So two minutes they do this.
他们这样做了两分钟。

00:11:22.502 --> 00:11:25.687
We then ask them, "How powerful
do you feel?" on a series of items,
然后我们问他们：“
你觉得自己有多强大？” 在一系列项目上，

00:11:25.711 --> 00:11:28.054
and then we give them
an opportunity to gamble,
然后我们给他们
一个赌博的机会，

00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:30.819
and then we take another saliva sample.
然后我们又采集了另一个唾液样本。

00:11:30.843 --> 00:11:32.701
That's it. That's the whole experiment.
就是这样。 这就是整个实验。

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:34.286
So this is what we find.
这就是我们发现的。

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.190
Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,
风险承受能力，也就是赌博，

00:11:36.214 --> 00:11:40.328
we find that when you are
in the high-power pose condition,
我们发现当你
处于高权力姿势的时候，

00:11:40.352 --> 00:11:42.486
86 percent of you will gamble.
86%的人会赌博。

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.606
When you're in the low-power
pose condition,
当你处于低功率
姿势状态时，

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.606
only 60 percent, and that's
a whopping significant difference.
只有 60%，这是
一个巨大的显着差异。

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.086
Here's what we find on testosterone.
这是我们在睾酮方面的发现。

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.623
From their baseline when they come in,
从他们进来时的基线来看，

00:11:53.647 --> 00:11:56.953
high-power people experience
about a 20-percent increase,
高权力的人经历了
大约 20% 的增长，

00:11:56.977 --> 00:12:01.574
and low-power people experience
about a 10-percent decrease.
而低权力的人经历了
大约 10% 的下降。

00:12:01.598 --> 00:12:04.391
So again, two minutes,
and you get these changes.
再说一遍，两分钟，
你就会得到这些变化。

00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:06.392
Here's what you get on cortisol.
这就是你从皮质醇中得到的结果。

00:12:06.416 --> 00:12:10.190
High-power people experience
about a 25-percent decrease,
高权力的人经历了
大约 25% 的减少，

00:12:10.214 --> 00:12:14.322
and the low-power people experience
about a 15-percent increase.
而低权力的人经历了
大约 15% 的增加。

00:12:14.346 --> 00:12:17.054
So two minutes lead
to these hormonal changes
因此，两分钟会
导致荷尔蒙发生变化，使

00:12:17.078 --> 00:12:18.698
that configure your brain
您的大脑

00:12:18.722 --> 00:12:22.999
to basically be either assertive,
confident and comfortable,
基本上变得自信、
自信和舒适，

00:12:23.023 --> 00:12:28.076
or really stress-reactive,
and feeling sort of shut down.
或者真正对压力敏感，
感觉有点封闭。

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.863
And we've all had the feeling, right?
我们都有过这种感觉，对吧？

00:12:30.887 --> 00:12:36.071
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern
how we think and feel about ourselves,
所以看来我们的非语言确实控制着
我们对自己的思考和感受，

00:12:36.095 --> 00:12:38.527
so it's not just others,
but it's also ourselves.
所以这不仅是别人的，
也是我们自己的。

00:12:38.551 --> 00:12:40.954
Also, our bodies change our minds.
此外，我们的身体会改变我们的想法。

00:12:40.978 --> 00:12:43.360
But the next question, of course,
但下一个问题当然

00:12:43.384 --> 00:12:45.204
is, can power posing for a few minutes
是，几分钟的强力姿势真的能

00:12:45.228 --> 00:12:47.265
really change your life
in meaningful ways?
以有意义的方式改变你的生活吗？

00:12:47.289 --> 00:12:51.582
This is in the lab, it's this little task,
it's just a couple of minutes.
这是在实验室里，这是一个小任务，
只需几分钟。

00:12:51.606 --> 00:12:53.347
Where can you actually apply this?
你可以在哪里实际应用这个？

00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:55.182
Which we cared about, of course.
当然，我们关心这一点。

00:12:55.206 --> 00:13:01.947
And so we think where you want to use this
is evaluative situations,
因此，我们认为您想要在
评估情况下使用它，

00:13:01.971 --> 00:13:04.424
like social threat situations.
例如社会威胁情况。 您的朋友在

00:13:04.448 --> 00:13:07.004
Where are you being evaluated,
either by your friends?
哪里对您进行评价
？

00:13:07.028 --> 00:13:09.085
For teenagers,
it's at the lunchroom table.
对于青少年来说，
它是在午餐桌上。

00:13:09.109 --> 00:13:13.382
For some people it's speaking
at a school board meeting.
对于某些人来说，这是
在学校董事会会议上的讲话。

00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:17.170
It might be giving a pitch
or giving a talk like this
它可能是进行推销
或进行这样的演讲

00:13:17.194 --> 00:13:19.968
or doing a job interview.
或进行工作面试。

00:13:19.992 --> 00:13:22.660
We decided that the one
that most people could relate to
我们决定，
大多数人都可以理解的面试就是工作面试，

00:13:22.684 --> 00:13:25.579
because most people had been through,
was the job interview.
因为大多数人都经历过
。

00:13:25.603 --> 00:13:28.334
So we published these findings,
所以我们发表了这些发现，

00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:29.919
and the media are all over it,
媒体都在关注它，

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:32.018
and they say, Okay, so this is what you do
他们说，好吧，这就是

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:34.115
when you go in
for the job interview, right?
你参加
工作面试时要做的，对吗？

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:35.146
(Laughter)
（笑声）

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.617
You know, so we were of course
horrified, and said,
你知道，所以我们当然感到
震惊，并说，

00:13:37.641 --> 00:13:39.913
Oh my God, no,
that's not what we meant at all.
天哪，不，
我们根本不是这个意思。

00:13:39.937 --> 00:13:42.177
For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.
由于多种原因，不，不要这样做。

00:13:42.201 --> 00:13:44.768
Again, this is not about you
talking to other people.
再说一遍，这不是你
与其他人交谈的问题。 这

00:13:44.792 --> 00:13:46.353
It's you talking to yourself.
是你自言自语。 在

00:13:46.377 --> 00:13:49.436
What do you do before you go
into a job interview? You do this.
参加工作面试之前你会做什么
？ 你做这个。

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.002
You're sitting down.
You're looking at your iPhone --
你坐下了。
您正在查看您的 iPhone

00:13:52.026 --> 00:13:54.288
or your Android, not trying
to leave anyone out.
或 Android，而不是试图将
任何人排除在外。

00:13:54.312 --> 00:13:56.182
You're looking at your notes,
你正在看你的笔记，

00:13:56.206 --> 00:13:58.206
you're hunching up, making yourself small,
你弯腰驼背，让自己变得渺小，而

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.659
when really what you should
be doing maybe is this,
你真正应该
做的也许是这样，

00:14:00.683 --> 00:14:03.720
like, in the bathroom, right?
Do that. Find two minutes.
比如，在浴室里，对吧？
去做。 找两分钟。

00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:05.506
So that's what we want to test. Okay?
这就是我们想要测试的。 好的？

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.324
So we bring people into a lab,
所以我们把人们带进实验室，

00:14:07.348 --> 00:14:10.701
and they do either high-
or low-power poses again,
他们再次摆出高权力
或低权力的姿势，

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.333
they go through
a very stressful job interview.
他们经历了
非常紧张的工作面试。

00:14:13.357 --> 00:14:16.949
It's five minutes long.
They are being recorded.
它有五分钟长。
他们正在被记录。

00:14:16.973 --> 00:14:18.930
They're being judged also,
他们也在接受评判，

00:14:18.954 --> 00:14:23.435
and the judges are trained
to give no nonverbal feedback,
评委们接受过
不提供非语言反馈的培训，

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:25.018
so they look like this.
所以他们看起来像这样。

00:14:25.245 --> 00:14:27.326
Imagine this is the person
interviewing you.
想象一下这是
面试你的人。

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.949
So for five minutes, nothing,
and this is worse than being heckled.
五分钟之内，什么也没有，
这比被质问更糟糕。

00:14:31.973 --> 00:14:33.613
People hate this.
人们讨厌这个。

00:14:33.637 --> 00:14:37.353
It's what Marianne LaFrance calls
"standing in social quicksand."
这就是玛丽安·拉弗朗斯所说的
“站在社会流沙中”。

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.162
So this really spikes your cortisol.
所以这确实会刺激你的皮质醇。

00:14:39.186 --> 00:14:41.472
So this is the job interview
we put them through,
这就是
我们对他们进行的面试，

00:14:41.496 --> 00:14:43.693
because we really wanted
to see what happened.
因为我们真的想
看看发生了什么。

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.800
We then have these coders look
at these tapes, four of them.
然后我们让这些编码员查看
这些磁带，共四盘。

00:14:46.824 --> 00:14:49.972
They're blind to the hypothesis.
They're blind to the conditions.
他们对这个假设视而不见。
他们对条件视而不见。

00:14:49.996 --> 00:14:52.757
They have no idea
who's been posing in what pose,
他们不知道
谁摆出了什么姿势，

00:14:52.781 --> 00:14:57.847
and they end up looking
at these sets of tapes,
最后他们看了
这些录像带，

00:14:57.871 --> 00:15:00.019
and they say,
"We want to hire these people,"
然后说，
“我们想雇用这些人”，

00:15:00.043 --> 00:15:01.544
all the high-power posers.
所有这些人都是高权力的摆姿势者。

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.341
"We don't want to hire these people.
“我们不想雇用这些人。

00:15:03.365 --> 00:15:07.182
We also evaluate these people
much more positively overall."
我们对这些人的总体评价也
更加积极。”

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:08.846
But what's driving it?
但是什么推动了它呢？

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.862
It's not about the content of the speech.
这与演讲的内容无关。

00:15:10.886 --> 00:15:13.738
It's about the presence
that they're bringing to the speech.
这是关于
他们在演讲中的表现。

00:15:13.762 --> 00:15:16.239
Because we rate them
on all these variables
因为我们根据与

00:15:16.263 --> 00:15:19.802
related to competence,
like, how well-structured is the speech?
能力相关的所有这些变量对他们进行评分，
例如演讲的结构如何？

00:15:19.826 --> 00:15:22.060
How good is it?
What are their qualifications?
有多好？
他们有什么资格？

00:15:22.084 --> 00:15:24.710
No effect on those things.
This is what's affected.
对那些东西没有影响。
这就是受到影响的。

00:15:24.734 --> 00:15:26.433
These kinds of things.
诸如此类的事情。 基本上，

00:15:26.457 --> 00:15:28.848
People are bringing
their true selves, basically.
人们正在展现
真实的自己。

00:15:28.872 --> 00:15:30.262
They're bringing themselves.
他们自己带来。

00:15:30.286 --> 00:15:32.385
They bring their ideas, but as themselves,
他们带来了自己的想法，但就像他们自己一样，

00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:34.621
with no, you know, residue over them.
你知道，没有任何残留。

00:15:34.645 --> 00:15:39.552
So this is what's driving the effect,
or mediating the effect.
所以这就是驱动效应
或调节效应的因素。

00:15:39.576 --> 00:15:42.920
So when I tell people about this,
因此，当我告诉人们这一点时，

00:15:42.944 --> 00:15:46.299
that our bodies change our minds
and our minds can change our behavior,
我们的身体改变我们的思想
，我们的思想可以改变我们的行为，

00:15:46.323 --> 00:15:49.075
and our behavior can change
our outcomes, they say to me,
我们的行为可以改变
我们的结果，他们对我说，

00:15:49.099 --> 00:15:50.642
"It feels fake." Right?
“这感觉很假。” 正确的？

00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:52.544
So I said, fake it till you make it.
所以我说，假装它直到你成功为止。

00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:54.421
It's not me.
这不是我。

00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:57.596
I don't want to get there
and then still feel like a fraud.
我不想到了那里
之后仍然感觉自己像个骗子。

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.430
I don't want to feel like an impostor.
我不想感觉自己像个骗子。

00:15:59.454 --> 00:16:03.527
I don't want to get there only to feel
like I'm not supposed to be here.
我不想到了那里只是
觉得我不应该在这里。

00:16:03.551 --> 00:16:05.714
And that really resonated with me,
这确实引起了我的共鸣，

00:16:05.738 --> 00:16:08.960
because I want to tell you
a little story about being an impostor
因为我想告诉你
一个关于作为冒名顶替者的小故事，

00:16:08.984 --> 00:16:11.182
and feeling like
I'm not supposed to be here.
并且感觉
我不应该在这里。

00:16:11.206 --> 00:16:14.123
When I was 19, I was
in a really bad car accident.
当我19岁的时候，我
遭遇了一场严重的车祸。

00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:17.528
I was thrown out of a car,
rolled several times.
我被从车里扔了出来，
滚了好几圈。

00:16:17.552 --> 00:16:19.410
I was thrown from the car.
我被从车上扔了下去。

00:16:19.434 --> 00:16:22.398
And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,
我在头部受伤康复病房醒来，

00:16:22.422 --> 00:16:24.631
and I had been withdrawn from college,
我已经从大学退学了，

00:16:24.655 --> 00:16:30.343
and I learned that my IQ had dropped
by two standard deviations,
我得知我的智商下降了
两个标准差，

00:16:30.367 --> 00:16:32.931
which was very traumatic.
这是非常痛苦的。

00:16:32.955 --> 00:16:35.802
I knew my IQ because
I had identified with being smart,
我知道自己的智商，因为
我认为自己很聪明，

00:16:35.826 --> 00:16:37.814
and I had been called gifted as a child.
小时候就被称为天才。

00:16:37.838 --> 00:16:41.014
So I'm taken out of college,
I keep trying to go back.
所以我从大学退学了，
我一直在努力回去。

00:16:41.038 --> 00:16:43.238
They say, "You're not going
to finish college.
他们说：“你不会
完成大学学业。

00:16:43.262 --> 00:16:45.815
Just, you know, there are other
things for you to do,
只是，你知道，
你还有其他事情要做，

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:47.839
but that's not going to work out for you."
但这对你来说是行不通的。”

00:16:47.863 --> 00:16:51.397
So I really struggled
with this, and I have to say,
所以我真的很挣扎
，我不得不说，

00:16:51.421 --> 00:16:54.171
having your identity taken
from you, your core identity,
你的身份被剥夺了
，你的核心身份被剥夺了，

00:16:54.195 --> 00:16:56.030
and for me it was being smart,
对我来说这是明智的，

00:16:56.054 --> 00:16:57.693
having that taken from you,
失去了你的身份，

00:16:57.717 --> 00:17:00.816
there's nothing that leaves you feeling
more powerless than that.
没有什么比这更让你感到
无能为力了。

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.619
So I felt entirely powerless.
所以我感到完全无能为力。

00:17:02.643 --> 00:17:04.505
I worked and worked, and I got lucky,
我工作又工作，我很幸运，我

00:17:04.529 --> 00:17:06.375
and worked, and got lucky, and worked.
工作，我很幸运，我工作。

00:17:06.399 --> 00:17:08.627
Eventually I graduated from college.
最终我大学毕业了。

00:17:08.651 --> 00:17:10.651
It took me four years
longer than my peers,
我
比同龄人多花了四年时间，

00:17:10.675 --> 00:17:14.992
and I convinced someone,
my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,
然后我说服了一个人，
我的天使顾问苏珊·菲斯克（Susan Fiske）

00:17:15.016 --> 00:17:17.936
to take me on,
and so I ended up at Princeton,
来接受我，
所以我最终来到了普林斯顿大学，

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.787
and I was like,
I am not supposed to be here.
我当时想，
我不应该在这里。

00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:22.081
I am an impostor.
我是个骗子。 在

00:17:22.105 --> 00:17:24.010
And the night before my first-year talk,
我第一年演讲的前一天晚上，

00:17:24.034 --> 00:17:27.533
and the first-year talk at Princeton
is a 20-minute talk to 20 people.
以及在普林斯顿大学的第一年演讲
是对 20 个人进行 20 分钟的演讲。

00:17:27.557 --> 00:17:28.735
That's it.
就是这样。

00:17:28.759 --> 00:17:31.222
I was so afraid of being
found out the next day
我很害怕
第二天被发现，

00:17:31.246 --> 00:17:34.035
that I called her
and said, "I'm quitting."
所以我打电话给她
说：“我要辞职了。”

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:35.891
She was like, "You are not quitting,
她说，“你不会放弃，

00:17:35.915 --> 00:17:38.449
because I took a gamble
on you, and you're staying.
因为我在你身上下了赌注
，而你要留下来。

00:17:38.473 --> 00:17:41.240
You're going to stay, and this is
what you're going to do.
你要留下来，这就是
你要做的。

00:17:41.264 --> 00:17:42.597
You are going to fake it.
你会假装它。

00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:45.777
You're going to do every talk
that you ever get asked to do.
你 你会做每
一次被要求做的演讲，

00:17:45.801 --> 00:17:48.040
You're just going to do it
and do it and do it,

00:17:48.064 --> 00:17:50.485
even if you're terrified
and just paralyzed
即使你感到害怕
、瘫痪

00:17:50.509 --> 00:17:52.858
and having an out-of-body experience,
并有灵魂出窍的经历，你也会做、做、做，

00:17:52.882 --> 00:17:56.228
until you have this moment where you say,
'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.
直到。 你有这样的时刻，你会说，
‘天哪，我正在这么做。

00:17:56.252 --> 00:17:59.194
Like, I have become this.
I am actually doing this.'"
’”

00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:00.313
So that's what I did.
所以我就是这么做的。

00:18:00.337 --> 00:18:01.721
Five years in grad school,
在研究生院读了五年，

00:18:01.745 --> 00:18:03.845
a few years, you know,
I'm at Northwestern,
几年，你知道，
我在西北大学，

00:18:03.869 --> 00:18:05.932
I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,
我搬到了哈佛，我在哈佛，

00:18:05.956 --> 00:18:09.932
I'm not really thinking about it anymore,
but for a long time I had been thinking,
我不再真正考虑它了，
但很长一段时间我一直在想，

00:18:09.956 --> 00:18:11.738
"Not supposed to be here."
“不应该在这里。”

00:18:11.762 --> 00:18:14.455
So at the end of my first year at Harvard,
因此，在我在哈佛的第一年结束时，一个

00:18:14.479 --> 00:18:18.780
a student who had not talked
in class the entire semester,
整个学期都没有在课堂上说话的学生走进了我的办公室，

00:18:18.804 --> 00:18:22.471
who I had said, "Look, you've gotta
participate or else you're going to fail,"
我曾对他说：“听着，你必须
参加，否则你就会失败。”

00:18:22.495 --> 00:18:25.019
came into my office.
I really didn't know her at all.
。
我真的根本不认识她。

00:18:25.043 --> 00:18:28.471
She came in totally defeated,
and she said,
她完全失败了，
她说：

00:18:28.495 --> 00:18:31.621
"I'm not supposed to be here."
“我不应该在这里。”

00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:37.328
And that was the moment for me.
那就是我的时刻。

00:18:37.352 --> 00:18:38.944
Because two things happened.
因为发生了两件事。

00:18:38.968 --> 00:18:40.238
One was that I realized,
一是我意识到，

00:18:40.262 --> 00:18:43.372
oh my gosh,
I don't feel like that anymore.
天哪，
我不再有那样的感觉了。

00:18:43.396 --> 00:18:46.396
I don't feel that anymore,
but she does, and I get that feeling.
我不再有这种感觉了，
但她有，而且我有这种感觉。

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.691
And the second was,
she is supposed to be here!
第二个是，
她应该在这里！

00:18:48.715 --> 00:18:50.668
Like, she can fake it, she can become it.
就像，她可以假装它，她可以成为它。

00:18:50.692 --> 00:18:54.235
So I was like, "Yes, you are!
You are supposed to be here!
所以我说，“是的，你是！
你应该在这里！

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.021
And tomorrow you're going to fake it,
明天你会假装它，

00:18:56.045 --> 00:18:58.734
you're going to make yourself
powerful, and, you know --
你会让自己变得
强大，而且，你知道 -

00:18:58.758 --> 00:19:04.151
(Applause)
（掌声）

00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:08.229
And you're going to go
into the classroom,
而你是
走进教室，

00:19:08.253 --> 00:19:10.653
and you are going to give
the best comment ever."
你就会给出
有史以来最好的评论。”

00:19:10.677 --> 00:19:13.658
You know? And she gave
the best comment ever,
你知道？ 她给出了
有史以来最好的评论，

00:19:13.682 --> 00:19:15.621
and people turned around and were like,
人们转过身来，说，

00:19:15.645 --> 00:19:18.565
oh my God, I didn't even notice her
sitting there. (Laughter)
天哪，我什至没有注意到她
坐在那里。  （笑声）

00:19:18.589 --> 00:19:20.382
She comes back to me months later,
几个月后她回到我身边，

00:19:20.406 --> 00:19:23.446
and I realized that she had not just
faked it till she made it,
我意识到她不仅仅是在
成功之前假装它，而是在她真正

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.844
